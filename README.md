# SSIS-Catalog-Archive
A repository containing code to archive SSISDB log tables. Managed by Tim Mitchell and Andy Leonard.

# The Story
Since 2018, Tim Mitchell has shared [A Better Way to Clean Up the SSIS Catalog Database](https://www.timmitchell.net/post/2018/12/30/clean-up-the-ssis-catalog/). 
Please visit Tim's post to learn more about _why_ his script is important - especially in enterprises using the SSIS Catalog to execute a large number of SSIS packages - _especially_ if said SSIS packages generate copious amounts of log data.

In 2021, Andy developed the initial version of SSIS Catalog Archive. Tim and Andy met and agreed to keep Tim's SSIS Catalog Purge script and SSIS Catalog Archive open-source and synchronized. And here we are!

# Getting Started
